The shared dependencies between the files we are generating include:

1. **Package Dependencies**: All files share dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. These include the Next.js framework, TypeScript, and any other libraries that are used across the application.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: All TypeScript files (`.tsx`) share the configuration defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. This includes compiler options and type checking rules.

3. **Next.js Configuration**: All files share the configuration defined in the `.next/config.js` file. This includes settings for server-side rendering and routing.

4. **React Components**: The `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` files are special Next.js files that wrap around all other pages. Therefore, any components, such as `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx`, used in these files are shared across all pages.

5. **CSS Styles**: All components share the global styles defined in `globals.css`. Additionally, the `Home.module.css` file is shared by any components that require the home page styles.

6. **Public Assets**: All files have access to the public assets, such as `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg`, located in the `public` directory.

7. **Function Names**: Any functions that are exported from one file and imported into another are shared dependencies. The exact names of these functions would depend on the specific implementation of the application.

8. **DOM Element IDs**: Any DOM elements that are targeted by JavaScript functions using their ID are shared dependencies. The exact IDs would depend on the specific implementation of the application.

9. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system, any message names that are used across multiple files are shared dependencies. The exact names would depend on the specific implementation of the application.
